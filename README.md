This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Udacity neighborhood map

This is the final project created for Udacity FEND Course

Clone this repo or download the zip file. 

To start app in development mode run npm install, and npm start in the project directory:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

# Service worker 

Note that service worker doesn't work in development mode.
